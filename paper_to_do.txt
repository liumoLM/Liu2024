# Friday Evening

Review table 1 column E --> need to write something about every entry

# Steve before Friday evening

Review the file correspondence_476_to_89_and_note.xlsx

Check vignette RMD / HTML

# Mo to do

Drop Fig 9, draft a table with the information just 89-type

Email willie about wild type 293t cell data


# Steve to do


Wait for fastqs from 293t cells to get to rozenlab, then upload to SRA

Re-diff vignette .rmd / spelling examplar -> exe... / suppress x axis labels (use new mSigPlot code)

Review ID10/C_ID10 -- our extraction got big green T/polyT insertion peak; ID10 has none, or 89/476 has some

Add to vignette

* Insdel4b The 89 type and 476 type extractions detect co-occurence of T insertions in long poly-T. This is a theme ....

* Insdel5b <same text as 4b>



# Waiting

# Lower priority presentation issues

Fig 6, legend and figure text

Fig 2, get rid of top colored bars in thumbnails

Fig 8 label highest peaks in panel A left side (83-type signatures)

# Below here not organized

drive shiny and vignettes off of same underlying data repository

in vignette indicate where 476 was extracted; when extracted, do auto-conversion


update the shiny – have function to generate plots before running

STEVE MOVE ON TO NOVEL SIGS

ID9 

ID_C/C_ID13 … ATA → AA / ATTA → AA

ID10/C_ID10 – need to discuss w/ Make this a note

ID17 – see text – Mo check the hartwig samples pcawg extracted 17 from 2 stomach exomes, need to revist the top2a paper

476 assignments? Would need to do some kind of subtraction to get the 476 signatures that we did not uses.


476 → 89 and check correspondence? Mo to get the pseudo-89 signatures (signatures compressed from 476 to 89)

Discordant exemplars for 89

e.g. 1c, 1d

fix decimal points in 89 plots, get rid of top bar by default
