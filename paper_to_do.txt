# Friday Evening

### Fig 9, put legend in same order as bars; gene order is different between A and B; why do the bars for the same gene in A and B look totally different,
especially in A we say slippage, but in B we say deficient MMR.  But they are same mutations so this is just distracting -- regarding mechanism.
In any case we need to talk about ID1 and ID2 not distinguishing MMR deficient from ordinary slippage.

Review table 1 column E --> need to write something about every entry

# Steve before Friday evening

Review the file correspondence_476_to_89_and_note.xlsx

Check vignette RMD / HTML

# Mo before Friday evening

respond on must up to date file for final 476 signatures

respond on RMD for new vignettes and provide access to the emailed HTML

# Waiting

Willie reply regarding fastq's or BAMs for HEK293T_RNAseH2b_cl{12,2,4}; email sent by steve Jan 8

# Lower priority presentation issues

Fig 6, legend and figure text

Fig 3. get rid of all top colored bars in thumbnails

Fig 2, get rid of top colored bars in thumbnails

Fig 8 label highest peaks in panel A left side (83-type signatures)

# Below here not organized

drive shiny and vignettes off of same underlying data repository

in vignette indicate where 476 was extracted; when extracted, do auto-conversion


update the shiny – have function to generate plots before running

STEVE MOVE ON TO NOVEL SIGS

ID9 

ID_C/C_ID13 … ATA → AA / ATTA → AA

ID10/C_ID10 – need to discuss w/ Make this a note

ID17 – see text – Mo check the hartwig samples pcawg extracted 17 from 2 stomach exomes, need to revist the top2a paper

476 assignments? Would need to do some kind of subtraction to get the 476 signatures that we did not uses.


476 → 89 and check correspondence? Mo to get the pseudo-89 signatures (signatures compressed from 476 to 89)

Discordant exemplars for 89

e.g. 1c, 1d

fix decimal points in 89 plots, get rid of top bar by default
