ID17 – see text – Mo check the hartwig samples pcawg extracted 17 from 2 stomach exomes, need to revist the top2a paper

476 assignments? Would need to do some kind of subtraction to get the 476 signatures that we did not uses.


476 → 89 and check correspondence? Mo to get the pseudo-89 signatures (signatures compressed from 476 to 89)

Discordant exemplars for 89
